//higher order functions

//key points
    //Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way thatâ€™s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers

    //We can work with functions the same way we would any other type of data including reassigning them to new variables

    //JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any object

    //Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters

    //A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both

//this function has a long discriptive name which is good but it could be terrible to have to repeat

  let is2p2 = checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes
  //its much easier to call is2p2 a bunch of times then calling checkThatTwoPlusTwoEqualsFourAMillionTimes a bunch of times but you still get to keep the discriptive name
