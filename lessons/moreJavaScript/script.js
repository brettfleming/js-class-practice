    //Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way thatâ€™s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers

    //We can work with functions the same way we would any other type of data including reassigning them to new variables

    //JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any object

    //Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters

//Iterators

//key points
    //.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.
    //.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
    //.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
    //.findIndex() returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.
    //.reduce() iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.

let story = 'Last weekend, I took literally the most beautiful bike ride of my life. The route is called "The 9W to Nyack" and it actually stretches all the way from Riverside Park in Manhattan to South Nyack, New Jersey. It\'s really an adventure from beginning to end! It is a 48 mile loop and it basically took me an entire day. I stopped at Riverbank State Park to take some extremely artsy photos. It was a short stop, though, because I had a really long way left to go. After a quick photo op at the very popular Little Red Lighthouse, I began my trek across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey.  The GW is actually very long - 4,760 feet! I was already very tired by the time I got to the other side.  An hour later, I reached Greenbrook Nature Sanctuary, an extremely beautiful park along the coast of the Hudson.  Something that was very surprising to me was that near the end of the route you actually cross back into New York! At this point, you are very close to the end.';
